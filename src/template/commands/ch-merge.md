# Merge Branch

Merge the current branch into the base branch with automatic conflict resolution.

This will:
1. If there are uncommitted changes, analyze them and create a meaningful commit automatically
2. Rebase the current branch onto the base branch
3. If conflicts occur, resolve them automatically without user interaction
4. Fast-forward merge the rebased branch into the base branch

All operations are performed automatically, including conflict resolution.
